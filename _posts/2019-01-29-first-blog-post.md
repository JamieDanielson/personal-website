**What a treat!**

This is officially the first Jekyll blog post that wasn't specifically covered via tutorial.

So far, I've changed settings like light to dark and sidebar to stacked, and also realized that in order to change my path on VSCode I simply had to restart it.  I was only able to access Jekyll from my Windows CMD which was confusing me, but as it turns out, a simple reboot of the editor was necessary to configure the environment variables.

Lots to learn and excited to keep working on this!
